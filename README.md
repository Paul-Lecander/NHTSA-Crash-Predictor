# **Group 3 Final Project - Segment 1**
## **Team**
 - Paul Lecander
 - Bryce Hutchins
 - David Leske
 - Halil Dudakovic
 - Vincent Winting

## **Topic Overview**
The team will create and online resource/app that allows a user to input certain factors about a future road trip to understand the likelihood of being injured in a crash, should a crash occur, based on historical accident data. Statistics and data visuals will be generated to give a fuller context to the under-lying dataset.

## **Dataset**
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) publishes multi-year datasets with the goal of saving lives, reducing injuries and reducing the economic costs of road traffic crashes. The dataset looks at a sample of nationally representative crashes annually for the years 2018 through 2020. The data set highlights dozens of data points for each of the accidents reported via public police records about each accident.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**
Initial exploratory data analysis will generate hypotheses for the most important factors that increase the likelihood of an auto accident. We will leverage the datasets contained in the accident, driverrf, vehicle, and weather csv files to perform our EDA.
